  "<p>While some expenditures varied seasonally, over the course of the ten months refugees were unable to decrease the costs of their highest expenses, rent and utilities.  Although we know that 66% of refugees have debt, we see that over time refugees are less able to pay down their debt, and less able to save.</p>",
  "<p>Transportation to school and education expenses are the biggest expenses related to children.  For families with four children or more, more money is spent on education, fresh foods and medicine.  This indicates that bigger families are able to more effectively share resources among their children, cutting costs in other areas.</p>",
